# UR5e Robotiq Gripper Visualization in RViz

This ROS 2 package provides a visualization setup for the UR5e robotic arm with a Robotiq gripper using RViz. It includes all necessary configuration files, launch files, and description files to get you started with visualizing the robot in a simulated environment.

## Features

- UR5e robotic arm and Robotiq gripper integration
- Ready-to-use RViz configuration
- Customizable Xacro files for robot descriptions

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- ROS 2
- RViz2

## Installation

To install the UR5e Robotiq Gripper Visualization package, follow these steps:

```bash
# Source your ROS 2 workspace
source /opt/ros/<ros2_distro>/setup.bash

# Clone the repository into your ROS 2 workspace
cd ~/your_ros2_ws/src
